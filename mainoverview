// 
In respect to photos, external photos should be saved locally on the tablet, and forwarded to the "end report"  I believe it is a word document, or something to that effect. Internal photos only need to be saved to the local tablet and not forwarded with the report

// To my understanding is that a "Tech" will document the initial interaction with this form and record events during the Receiption and Disassembly.  A second person the "Inspector" will take over this process and will basically QC the existing input, and then will finish recording the documentation

//Procedural information does't need to be tracked outside of this form, and is only to aid in the process of this form moving between other techs and the inspector

// I should note some sort of documentation.

"//" ... "//" areas of comments and notes multi line, single lead //for single line comment
items in "parenthesis" 
Iems flagged between *astricks* at the end of a line are indications of where data should go.
such as *internal* to save to local device only
or *external* to save to local device, and forward at the end with the report
Comments follow #poundsign are procedural or event related
